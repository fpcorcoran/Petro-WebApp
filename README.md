# Petro-WebApp

## The goal of this project is to visualize the relationship between climate data and petroleum imports at coastal ports over time

## The app includes:
### - A map of 30 coastal port cities. The net monthly petroleum import is directly proportional to the radius, and color indicates net monthly rainfall (blue = more rain, red = less rain)
### - A time series of the West Texas Intermediate - Cushing, Oklahoma, a global crude oil price idex
### - A bar chart area where the data of a selected can be visualized by selecting it from the map (data includes shipment countries of origin, product types, and receiving companies)
