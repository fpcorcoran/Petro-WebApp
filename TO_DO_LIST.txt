This list specifies the design steps neccessary to create a more interactive PetroWebApp (working title)

GOALS:
(repuired)
1) The WTI crude oil index ticker should be clickable and dragable (CHECK) 
2) Circle radii/colors should respond to the movement of the ticker (CHECK)
3) Bar chart should respond to the movement of ticker
	- dispatch the creation of the bar charts from the circle selection and/or type selection
		- maybe store time state of the model in an attribute of the type buttons on each transition? (when type is changed, get current time state from attribute of button)
	- dispatch changes in transition of the bar charts from the ticker movement
4) Bar chart elements should show raw data value when moused over
(optional)
5) Bar chart elements should re-sort themselves on each transition so so that the largest value is on top
6) Popup window should appear on timeseries when moused over, showing date and WTI index value (CHECK)

THINGS TO TRY:
1) size circles by area instead of radius
2) size circles by percent of national total instead of gross imports
3) resize circles on zoom (use the zoom level as a scaler for circle size)
